# Contributing

While contributions are welcomed, consider following:

- Development requires [ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which relies on [docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) is required.
- Especially for larger contributions, create an issue first to discuss the idea.

## Getting started

```shell
ddev start
ddev composer install
```

## Code Quality

See composer scripts for code quality tools.
